## Installation

FLR4MFCL depends on FLCore (FLR-project) which itself depends on iterators.
```{r}
install.packages("iterators")
install.packages("FLCore", repos="http://flr-project.org/R")
install.packages("remotes")

library(remotes)
install_github("PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-flr4mfcl")
```

NOTE: Installation from github may fail due to warning messages being elevated to errors. You can override this behaviour by setting the environment variable in R as follows and re-running the install_github command - but use with caution because some warnings may not be completely benign!
```{r}
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")
```
